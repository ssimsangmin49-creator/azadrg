    <h1>Introduction of the Technology</h1>

    <p>
      This technology introduces an environmentally sustainable approach 
      to the incineration of polymer compounds. It focuses on the production 
      and deployment of appropriate technologies that enable the environmentally 
      friendly (odor-free, smoke-free, dioxin-free) incineration of polymer compounds.
    </p>

    <p>
      The process is designed for non-commercial research purposes and
      regions where patent restrictions do not apply.
    </p>

    <h2>Background</h2>

    <p>
      Polymer waste disposal has become a serious environmental issue due to 
      the generation of secondary pollutants during the incineration process. 
      Furthermore, there are limitations to the environmentally sound disposal 
      of massive amounts of MSW.

      Therefore, methods for incinerating polymer compounds locally and 
      environmentally soundly must be explored. 
      However, such technologies need not conflict with public opinion 
      opposing polymer incineration.

      By sharing and implementing technologies and methods, we must accumulate 
      data to gain global recognition and contribute to addressing 
      global environmental issues.
    </p>

    <h2>Key Concept</h2>

    <p>
      This method utilizes multiple layers of air curtains within the circular incinerator 
      to maintain a high internal temperature to prevent the release of dioxins. 
      It also produces no odor or smoke, eliminating the need for additional smoke reduction equipment.

      Furthermore, the gases emitted through the top cover alone meet international 
      environmental standards without the need for additional equipment.

    <h2>Main Effects</h2>

    <p>
      This method prevents smoke or odor from emitting from the ignition stage. 
      Furthermore, by trapping the heat of incineration, it maintains high temperatures 
      and prevents the release of harmful gases.
      Typically, the internal temperature of an incinerator is maintained
      above 850 degrees Celsius during the incineration of polymer compounds.
    </p>


  <h2>Operational limitations</h2>

    <p>
      Incinerators can be manufactured with internal sizes ranging from as small as 
      300 mm to as large as 2,000 mm. For larger capacities,
      incinerators must be connected in series or parallel.
