      <strong>Purpose of this page:</strong>
      We separate <em>definitions</em> from <em>explanations</em>.
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Terminology (Simplified)</strong> = short, plain definitions</li>

    <!-- =========================================================
         1) Terminology (Simplified)
         ========================================================= -->
    <h2>Terminology (Simplified)</h2>
    
    <h3>Synthetic Polymer Compound Waste(SPCW)</h3>
      <P>
      In this document, SPCW (Synthetic Polymer Compound Waste) is used as a general term
      for plastics and other synthetic polymer materials that are particularly difficult
      to oxidize completely using conventional thermal treatment methods.
      </P>
    
    <h3>Thermal Treatment</h3>
    <p>
      A general term describing processes that use controlled high temperatures to transform materials.
      In this project, thermal treatment refers to a <strong>non-incineration-based process</strong> designed to safely
      decompose and oxidize SPCW while minimizing toxic byproducts.
    </p>

    <h3>High-Temperature Pyrolysis (Historical Term)</h3>
    <p>
      Originally used to describe the early stage of this method, where polymer compounds undergo high-temperature thermal decomposition.
      While <em>pyrolysis</em> typically implies the absence of oxygen, this technology extends beyond pure pyrolysis.
    </p>

    <h3>Oxidation</h3>
    <p>
      A reaction stage where thermally decomposed gases react with oxygen in a controlled manner.
      Here, oxidation is part of a structured multi-stage pathway.
    </p>

    <h3>Complete Oxidation</h3>
    <p>
      The condition in which thermally decomposed gases are fully oxidized into stable end products (e.g., CO₂ and H₂O).
      In this project, complete oxidation is <strong>structurally ensured</strong> to reduce incomplete intermediates and toxic byproducts.
    </p>

    <h3>Why Not “Incineration”</h3>
    <p>
      Incineration typically refers to <strong>heterogeneous solid-waste combustion</strong>strong>, where waste is directly burned and complete oxidation is achieved 
      through staged air supply and downstream post-combustion treatment. <strong>This system can be viewed as a subset within the broader 
      thermal treatment spectrum</strong>, but it follows a fundamentally different reaction architecture.

      Rather than relying primarily on diffusion-dominant solid combustion, the primary zone operates as a <strong>pyrolytically driven gas 
      generator</strong> optimized for SPCW, forming a controlled <strong>gas-phase reaction environment</strong> under high-temperature refractory conditions (≥1200 °C). 
      Oxidation then proceeds predominantly through <strong>premixed gas-phase pathways</strong>, structurally oriented toward complete oxidation 
      within the thermal flow itself rather than depending solely on secondary combustion chambers.

      For clarity, the process is described as an <strong>SPCW-optimized gas-phase thermal oxidation system</strong>, 
      emphasizing its <strong>reaction architecture</strong> rather than excluding it from the broader family of thermal treatment technologies.
    </p>

    <h3>Best One-Line Description</h3>
    <p>
      A high-temperature thermal treatment process in which SPCW undergoes controlled thermal decomposition,
      followed by structurally ensured complete oxidation, without conventional incineration.
    </p>

         2) Why we use these terms (FAQ)
         ========================================================= -->
    <h2>Why We Use These Terms (FAQ)</h2>

    <details open>
      <summary>Q1. Why does this system focus on SPCW?</summary>
      <div class="faq-body">
        <p>
          The system focuses on Synthetic Polymer Compound Waste (SPCW) because it represents
          the most technically demanding class of combustible waste.
        </p>
        <p>
          SPCW includes plastics and flame-retardant polymer materials that are resistant to
          complete oxidation and are more likely to generate hazardous byproducts when treated
          using conventional batch-type or plasma-based systems.
        </p>
        <p>
          By designing the system around SPCW as the baseline condition, the technology is
          engineered to operate reliably under the most difficult thermal and chemical
          constraints. As a result, other combustible wastes naturally fall within the
          operational margin without requiring separate optimization.
        </p>
      </div>
    </details>
    
      <details>
      <summary>Q2. Why do we avoid the word “incineration”?</summary>
      <div class="faq-body">
        <p>
          “Incineration” is commonly understood as <strong>burning waste for disposal</strong>, and the word often carries assumptions:
          smoke, uncontrolled burning, and large-scale commercial incinerators.
          This project focuses on a <strong>controlled, staged thermal process</strong> (decomposition → oxidation → complete oxidation),
          so we use <code>thermal treatment</code> to reflect the mechanism more accurately and reduce misunderstanding.
        </p>
      </div>
    </details>

    <details>
      <summary>Q3. But visually, isn’t it still “incineration”?</summary>
      <div class="faq-body">
        <p>
          It can look similar from the outside because high temperatures and oxidation occur.
          The difference is the <strong>structure of the process</strong>:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Lower zone:</strong> thermal decomposition (pyrolysis-like behavior)</li>
          <li><strong>Upper zones:</strong> staged oxidation</li>
          <li><strong>Outcome:</strong> structurally ensured <strong>complete oxidation</strong> and a stable high-temperature environment</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          In short: it is “incineration-like” in appearance (high-temperature oxidation exists),
          but it is not conventional incineration in intent and mechanism.
        </p>
      </div>
    </details>

    <details>
      <summary>Q4. Why keep the word “pyrolysis” at all?</summary>
      <div class="faq-body">
        <p>
          Historically, the early stage was called “high-temperature pyrolysis” because it behaves like thermal decomposition.
          However, the system continues into oxidation and complete oxidation.
          That’s why the current framing is <strong>pyrolysis-based thermal treatment</strong>
          (pyrolysis-like initiation + controlled oxidation pathway).
        </p>
      </div>
    </details>

    <details>
      <summary>Q5. Why say “complete oxidation” instead of “complete combustion”?</summary>
      <div class="faq-body">
        <p>
          “Combustion” easily evokes flames and incineration. The scientific point here is not the presence of fire,
          but whether oxidation reaches stable end products without incomplete intermediates.
          Therefore we use <strong>complete oxidation</strong> to describe the outcome more precisely and neutrally.
        </p>
      </div>
    </details>

    <details>
      <summary>Q6. Why does terminology matter so much for a new approach?</summary>
      <div class="faq-body">
        <p>
          In new methods, terminology becomes the “first footprint in snow.”
          Words shape how others evaluate safety, intent, and mechanism.
          We prefer mechanism-centered terms over familiar but misleading labels,
          so the technology can be discussed and tested on accurate grounds.
        </p>
      </div>
    </details>

    <details>
      <summary>Q7. One sentence: what is this technology?</summary>
      <div class="faq-body">
        <p>
          This is a <strong>high-temperature thermal treatment</strong> method in which SPCW undergoes controlled thermal decomposition,
          followed by staged oxidation and <strong>structurally ensured complete oxidation</strong>, without relying on conventional incineration.
