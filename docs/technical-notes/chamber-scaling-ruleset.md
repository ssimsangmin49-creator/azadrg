## SPCW Thermal Treatment: Concept & Reactor Behavior Framework

This page declares the conceptual foundation of SPCW thermal treatment
based on reactor behavior rather than fixed engineering dimensions.

It is not a construction manual.

Specific sizes, values, and operating parameters are intentionally left
to field development, as SPCW characteristics vary widely across locations
and feed conditions.


---

## 1. Design Philosophy

The system is designed as a vertical thermal reaction space where:

- material enters from the top
- feedstock naturally falls toward the lower zone
- high-temperature decomposition occurs near the bottom
- generated gases rise upward and undergo staged oxidation

Geometry is defined by proportional behavior rather than absolute measurements.


---

## 2. Reactor Behavior Standard

Instead of fixed dimensions, the following behavior zones define the reactor:

### Lower Zone — Reaction Origin
- Primary location of thermal decomposition
- Accumulation and transformation of SPCW
- Central rod anchored from the lower structure moderates gas release

### Middle Zone — Mixing Transition
- Rising gases interact with staged air injection
- Flow stabilization and reaction continuity

### Upper Zone — Gas-Phase Oxidation
- Completion of oxidation process
- Thermal energy exits the chamber naturally or is recovered downstream


This zonal behavior remains consistent regardless of reactor size.

## 3. Scaling Principle

Scaling is declared through proportional relationships only.

Examples include:

- chamber height relative to diameter
- staged air positioning along reactor height
- rod proportions aligned with reaction behavior

Absolute values are not standardized here.
Field validation determines final configurations.


---

## 4. Central Rod — Functional Declaration

The central rod is defined as a reaction moderator rather than a structural centerpiece.

Its configuration may vary depending on SPCW characteristics, including:

- inland synthetic polymer wastes
- marine-derived mixed debris
- moisture and density variations

Rod proportions and sectional design are expected to evolve through field data.


---

## 5. Optional Reaction Modules

The reactor architecture may include optional elements depending on site requirements:

- extended chamber height for higher SPCW throughput
- staged rod sections in the lower region
- optional agitation mechanisms to stabilize solid-phase behavior

These elements are not fixed standards but adaptive modules.


---

## 6. WTE Compatibility (Concept Level)

The reactor may operate purely as a reaction-oriented system or
be configured for waste-to-energy (WTE) applications.

When WTE is applied:

- heat extraction occurs downstream
- external steam generation or heat exchange may be used
- modular parallel reactors may share a common thermal header

Purpose-specific configurations are discussed separately.


---

## 7. Field-Centered Development

This declaration establishes only the behavioral framework.

Detailed parameters are expected to emerge from:

- size-specific field operation
- SPCW-type variation
- iterative airflow and internal configuration adjustments

No single configuration is considered universal.


---

## 8. Design Intent

This system is not defined by conventional incinerator terminology.

It represents a reactor-based approach to SPCW thermal treatment,
where stability arises from flow behavior, staged oxidation,
and adaptive field development.

The goal is a framework that can be applied anywhere —
from remote regions to dense urban environments —
without dependence on fixed mechanical formulas.W feed.
