# Field test results-01: Things you should never do!

Most polymer waste is not separated and disposed of properly. It's often mixed with other types of waste  
or indiscriminately placed in plastic bags and disposed of.   

There's one thing to keep in mind when building and operating the incinerator introduced here.  
Of course, this incident actually happened, and the lesson learned has been recorded and shared with others.

## Inserting butane or isobutane cans into the incinerator

While we are advised to puncture and dispose of most butane gas or isobutane cans,  
which we discard after using them outdoors or for one-time use, most are simply discarded.  

These cans, discarded individually, but especially the large number of butane gas or isobutane cans   
discarded in various bags, pose a significant risk to the incinerators described here.   
This is because smaller incinerators typically use relatively little refractory material to construct their incinerators.   
Simply put, circular incinerators have a limited refractory thickness.  

Unperforated butane gas or isobutane cans can explode when exposed to high temperatures,  
as the residual gas and air inside rapidly expand. 
If multiple cans of butane or isobutane gas explode simultaneously inside an incinerator,  
the effect is similar to detonating a bomb inside the incinerator, causing a significant shock to  
the refractory material supporting the incinerator interior. 
Ultimately, this can render the incinerator unusable.

## Real field case

The incinerator introduced here has an internal diameter of less than 2,500 mm.  
When the top lid of this type of incinerator is closed and the waste is fed into the inlet,  
the volume is limited by the size of the inlet. This was the case.  

Most of the collected waste was contained in black plastic bags. The bags varied in size. 
Therefore, instead of opening the bags and feeding their contents through the conveyor into the incinerator,   
the incinerator lid was opened and the bags were fed directly into the incinerator through the top. 
Shortly thereafter, several explosions occurred.   
After shutting down the incinerator and allowing it to cool, the ash was sorted.  
Twelve butane gas canisters had burst from the explosions. The incinerator walls were also damaged.  

In such cases, the incinerator required major repairs.  
First, all the refractory material on the inner walls had to be removed and re-coated.
