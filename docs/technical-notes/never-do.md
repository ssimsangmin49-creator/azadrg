# Field test results-01: Things you should never do!

Most polymer waste is not separated and disposed of properly. It's often mixed with other types of waste  
or indiscriminately placed in plastic bags and disposed of.   

There's one thing to keep in mind when building and operating the incinerator introduced here.  
Of course, this incident actually happened, and the lesson learned has been recorded and shared with others.

## Inserting butane or isobutane cans into the incinerator

While we are advised to puncture and dispose of most butane gas or isobutane cans,  
which we discard after using them outdoors or for one-time use, most are simply discarded.  

These cans, discarded individually, but especially the large number of butane gas or isobutane cans   
discarded in various bags, pose a significant risk to the incinerators described here.   
This is because smaller incinerators typically use relatively little refractory material to construct their incinerators.   
Simply put, circular incinerators have a limited refractory thickness.  

Unperforated butane gas or isobutane cans can explode when exposed to high temperatures,  
as the residual gas and air inside rapidly expand. 
If multiple cans of butane or isobutane gas explode simultaneously inside an incinerator,  
the effect is similar to detonating a bomb inside the incinerator, causing a significant shock to  
the refractory material supporting the incinerator interior. 
Ultimately, this can render the incinerator unusable.
