# Field test results-02: Appropriate amount of waste input into incinerator

### The appropriate amount of waste input into the incinerator introduced here should be below  
### the lower stage 1 air nozzle of the rod located inside the incinerator.

Regardless of whether continuous feeding is used, the amount of waste fed into the incinerator must always   
be below the height of the first air nozzle at the bottom of the rod. 
This is because the air curtain created by the first air nozzle at the bottom of the rod separates   
thermal decomposition and combustion due to the primary high temperature at the bottom of the incinerator.

## When waste is thrown higher than the height of the first air nozzle at the bottom of the rod

High temperatures can cause incomplete combustion when thermal decomposition and combustion are combined.   
This occurs when flames that are not fully combusted during the combustion process are forced to undergo the next stage, incineration.
