### Reaction Behavior & Flame Regime in SPCW Thermal Processing


## 1. Scope of This Note

This technical note introduces two working concepts used throughout the AZADrg project:
- **Reaction behavior**
- **Flame regime**

These terms are not presented as formal combustion classifications.
They are practical descriptors intended to explain observed thermal processes that do not align cleanly with conventional incineration terminology.


## 2. Reaction Behavior

<strong>Reaction behavior</strong> refers to how a material responds under sustained high-temperature exposure, rather than what the material is called or categorized as.

In this context, materials are not grouped primarily by chemical name or waste classification, but by shared thermal response characteristics such as:
- gas-phase generation tendency
- oxidation pathway dominance
- soot formation behavior
- transition from solid phase to reactive vapor environment

The term <strong>Synthetic Polymer Compound Waste (SPCW)</strong> is therefore used as a reaction-behavior grouping, not a regulatory waste category.

This distinction is important because different polymer-dominant materials may exhibit similar oxidation dynamics despite differing compositions.


## 3. Flame Regime (Provisional Field Concept)

<strong>Flame regime</strong> is used here as a descriptive term for the overall combustion environment created by reaction behavior under controlled thermal conditions.

Observed characteristics may include:
- low-luminosity or blue-dominant flames
- reduced visible soot radiation
- gas-phase oxidation prevailing over surface burning
- refractory environments exceeding typical solid-burn expectations

The term is intentionally provisional.

This project does not attempt to redefine established combustion taxonomy.
Instead, it uses “flame regime” to describe an operational observation: the system behaves more like a gas-phase reacting environment than a conventional mass-burn incineration process.

Formal flame characterization remains outside the current scope and may evolve through future field observation and collaboration with combustion researchers.


## 4. Relationship Between Reaction Behavior and Flame Regime

Within this framework:

Reaction behavior → influences → flame regime formation
Flame regime → influences → emission characteristics and thermal stability

The emphasis is therefore placed on understanding thermal response patterns rather than waste identity alone.


## 5. Why These Terms Are Used

Conventional incineration language often assumes:
- dominant solid-phase burning
- visible radiant flames
- waste classification as the primary design basis

However, field observations within the AZADrg system suggest a different emphasis:
- gas-phase oxidation environments
- low-luminosity flame conditions
- reaction-behavior-driven processing

The use of “reaction behavior” and “flame regime” allows these observations to be described without overstating formal scientific claims.


## 6. Working Status

These definitions are <strong>living descriptors</strong>, not final scientific terminology.

They are intended to:
- support clear communication
- reduce rhetorical ambiguity
- invite future theoretical refinement by combustion and reaction researchers.
