# Field test results-03: Chamber making!

Refractory cement is a hydraulic, heat-resistant building material made primarily of alumina and limestone 
that can withstand high temperatures (1,000°C to 1,800°C or higher). 
It is used for the installation and maintenance of high-temperature furnace linings in furnaces, kilns, stoves, and chimneys.

It is available in two forms: refractory mortar (refractory cement) for bonding refractory bricks and castable for direct pouring.

This section introduces a chamber made of castable for direct pouring.
